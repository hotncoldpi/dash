# Agent Dashboard

This is a .NET Core 2.2 application that provides a temperature agent dashboard and single-agent gauge via a REST API 
and HTML web pages (jQuery/Knockout/Bootstrap). It runs behind an Apache2 reverse proxy that is configured
via setup_dash.sh. It has been successfully tested on Debian, Ubuntu, and Raspbian.
